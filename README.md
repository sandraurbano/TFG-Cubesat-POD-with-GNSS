## GNSS-Based Navigation Method for Precise Orbit Determination in CubeSats

### Overview
This repository contains the code and resources developed as part of the final degree project work titled "GNSS-Based Navigation Method for Precise Orbit Determination in CubeSats". The project aims to investigate the feasibility of using this methods by analyzing the effect of perturbations in LEO region, asses the visbility of GPS satellites for different orbits and determine the precision of this methods.

### Project Structure
The main folders in this repository are organized as follows:
- Cubesat Model: Contains Simulink models for cubesat orbit propagation, both with and without perturbations.
- Data: Stores datasets, simulation outputs, and experimental data used in the project.
- Model Configuration: Includes configuration files for setting up the simulation environment and parameters.
- Model Visualization: Contains scripts for visualizing simulation results.
- Post-processing: Includes scripts and functions for analyzing simulation data and generating reports on GPS visibility.
- Results: Stores generated results, plots, and reports from project experiments.
